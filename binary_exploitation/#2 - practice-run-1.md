### Description
*"You're going to need to know how to run programs if you're going to get out of here. Navigate to /problems/practice-run-1_0_62b61488e896645ebff9b6c97d0e775e on the shell server and run this program to receive a flag."*

### Solution
This one is pretty simple. All you have to do for this problem is run the program in the directory that the problem gives you. So, we just need to ssh into the picoCTF server, move into the directory, and run the program. Here's all of the commands to do that:
```
$ ssh {your_username}@2019shell1.picoctf.com
$ cd /problems/practice-run-1_0_62b61488e896645ebff9b6c97d0e775e
$ ./run_this
```

You don't even need to move into the directory to run it:
```
$ ssh {your_username}@2019shell1.picoctf.com
$ /problems/practice-run-1_0_62b61488e896645ebff9b6c97d0e775e/run_this
```

This will print out the flag.
