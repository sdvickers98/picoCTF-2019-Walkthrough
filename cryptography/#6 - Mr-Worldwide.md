*"A musician left us a message. What's it mean?"*

The problem gives us this text:

picoCTF{(35.028309, 135.753082)(46.469391, 30.740883)(39.758949, -84.191605)(41.015137, 28.979530)(24.466667, 54.366669)(3.140853, 101.693207)_(9.005401, 38.763611)(-3.989038, -79.203560)(52.377956, 4.897070)(41.085651, -73.858467)(57.790001, -152.407227)(31.205753, 29.924526)}

If you've ever seen numbers like these before, you probably recognized that they are geographic coordinates. If you use [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/), 
or a similar service, you can figure out that these coordinates point to different major cities around the world.

As always, I recommend doing the legwork yourself, but here is the solution and flag.
