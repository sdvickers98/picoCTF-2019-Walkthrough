# 13
*"Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is? cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}"*

This one isn't too bad. In fact, it tells you how to solve it. 

If you haven't heard of it already, a quick google search will tell you that ROT13 is a letter substitution cipher that encodes an alphabetic message by replacing each letter with the letter that comes 13 letters before/after it alphabetically. In fact, that same google search will probably also show you [this](https://rot13.com/) website, which should help you with the rest of the problem. 

If you want to put in a little more effort (and maybe have a little more fun?), you can try writing a script to do decode the message for you. Here's a small python script I wrote to do it:

```python
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

def rot13(message):
	new_message = ''
	for char in message.lower():
		if char in alphabet:
			new_message += alphabet[(alphabet.index(char) + 13) % 26]
		else:
			new_message += char
			
def main():
	message = 'cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}'
	print(rot13(message))
	
if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()
```
