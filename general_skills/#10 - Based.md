### Description
*"To get truly 1337, you must understand different data encodings, such as hexadecimal or binary. Can you get the flag from this program to prove you are on the way to becoming 1337? Connect with nc 2019shell1.picoctf.com 20836."*

### Solution
Running the command will ask you to convert numbers from a few different bases to ASCII strings. I've provided links for some converter websites that will help 
with this one. You can also look into [binascii](https://docs.python.org/3/library/binascii.html) if you're interested in doing this programatically.
