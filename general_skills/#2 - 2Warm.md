# Description
*"Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?"*

# Solution
I'm not going to go too deep into the binary number system. If you aren't familiar with it already, you can find a pretty intuitive tutorial [here](https://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-number-system.html) that will help you become familiar with binary numbers.

You can do this really easily in python:
```python
bin(42)
```
And we get the output `0b101010`.
