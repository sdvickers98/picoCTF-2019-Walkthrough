# First Grep
100 points

### Description
*"Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way. You can also find the file in /problems/first-grep_6_c2319e8af66fa6bec197edc733dd52dd on the shell server."*

### Solution
This question is meant to test your knowledge of the command `grep`. This command is used to search through files to find lines that match certain patters.
You can learn more about it by reading the [linux man page] for `grep`.
```
$ grep 'pico' file
```

This command said to search "file" for any lines containing the string "pico". This command gives us the flag.
