# Resources

### Description
*"We put together a bunch of resources to help you out on our website! If you go over there, you might even find a flag! https://picoctf.com/resources (link)"*

### Solution
This is a pretty easy one if you know where to look. So if you visit this link, you'll want to look at the page's source code. I'm using Firefox on Linux Mint, 
so I can do that with Ctrl+u. It may be different for you, just check what the keybinding is for your browser and operating system.

Now that we are viewing the page source, we can just use Ctrl+f to search for "picoCTF{" on the page to find the flag.
